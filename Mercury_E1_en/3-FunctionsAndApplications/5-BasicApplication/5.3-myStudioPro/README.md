# What is myStudio Pro?

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.2/5.2.1/img/myblockly/myblockly界面.jpg" alt="blank" />

**myStudio Pro** is a robot programming and control software integrating multiple functions, providing users with one-stop solutions such as visual programming interaction, quick movement control, drag teaching, robot status query and configuration. The software mainly integrates four functional modules: `myBlockly`, `Quick Move`, `Firmware and Applications`, and `Settings`, covering the entire process requirements from programming to debugging, from learning to deployment.

The **`myBlockly`** module draws on Scratch, a children's programming language developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in terms of functionality and design concept, and uses a graphical building block assembly method for programming. Users can gradually build a complete code logic by intuitively dragging and dropping module combinations. The entire process is simple to operate and easy to understand, making it especially suitable for programming beginners and teaching scenarios.


From the perspective of user experience, **myBlockly** is a low-threshold visual code generation tool that makes programming as easy and intuitive as building with blocks. From the perspective of developers, this module is essentially a text editor capable of dynamically generating structured code. The code generated by users through drag-and-drop interactions will eventually be transformed into a sequence of instructions that can be executed on robots. This design and interaction method not only reduce the difficulty of use but also ensure the professionalism and executability of the program.

**Quick Move**

The module focuses on the rapid positioning and real-time control of the robotic arm. The rapid movement function can quickly move the robotic arm to the designated position. The read and write states of the end and bottom IO can be set. In addition, the module provides a dedicated operation area, supporting step-by-step or continuous motion control of joints or coordinates, achieving high-precision position adjustment and flexible motion debugging.

**Firmware and Applications**

The module provides users with a convenient resource navigation function, centrally displaying the entry points of commonly used external links, including firmware downloads, technical documents, official contact information, etc. Users can quickly access relevant supporting materials without manually searching, improving the efficiency of use and maintenance.

**Settings**

The module covers the basic configuration options of software and robot systems. Users can perform operations such as language switching, joint movement limit setting, system update detection and update here.

# myStudio Pro interface display and the use of basic functions

Open the software. The main interface is as shown in the following figure.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.3-myStudioPro/home/home.png" alt="blank" />

Interface function introduction: The interface is divided into three areas:

1. Reset to zero and power on/off
2. Function realization
3. Information display

Note: The software will automatically communicate and connect to the machine. If the lower right corner shows "Not connected", please check whether the network connection between the PC and the machine is unobstructed, or try restarting the machine.

## Return to zero

The function of this button is to control all the joints of the robot to return to the zero position.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.3-myStudioPro/home/zero.png" alt="blank" />

**Note :**  The function of this button takes effect only if the communication of the robot has been successfully connected. After long pressing and clicking this button with the left mouse button, the robot will start to execute the return-to-zero command. The mechanical arm will slowly move to the zero position. Once the mouse button is released after long pressing, the return-to-zero command stops executing.

After the zeroing process is completed, a pop-up window will appear to prompt that the zeroing is done.
