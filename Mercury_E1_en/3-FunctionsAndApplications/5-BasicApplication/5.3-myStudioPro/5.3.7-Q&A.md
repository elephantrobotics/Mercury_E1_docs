# Q&A

This chapter lists frequently asked questions about using myStudio Pro to control a robotic arm for your reference.

**Q1: ​​When running myBlockly, the error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymycobot'` appears.**

A: This is because the pymycobot library was not installed when setting up the Python environment. To install the pymycobot library, open a terminal (Win key + R key), type `pip install pymycobot --upgrade --user` and press Enter. You should then see "pymycobot installed successfully".

**Q2: The robotic arm is not responding because the `sleep` method module was not added?** **
**A:** The program for operating the robotic arm takes a certain amount of time to complete. Therefore, after completing one action, a `sleep` module needs to be connected to allow the robotic arm sufficient time before performing the next action (the required time depends on the specific situation and machine; the default setting for the robotic arm is a minimum sleep time of 0.5 seconds when running myBlockly). Otherwise, the robotic arm will not be able to perform the desired actions.

**Q3:** SSH connection failure

**A:** This is generally caused by a poor network cable connection. Try unplugging and replugging the network cable from the PC. When the control panel detects the connection (usually as Ethernet), open the Windows command prompt and use the `ping` command to check. If normal output is available, try connecting via SSH. If the above steps do not solve the problem, try restarting the machine.

**Q4:** Why does the browser remain in the loading stage or fail to access the IP address? **

A: Please ensure your PC and robotic arm are on the same local area network (you can ping the robotic arm's IP address from your PC). Try using a different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended) and refresh the cache (Ctrl + F5).

**Q5:** Why can't I control the gripper using blocks in myBlockly programming?


A: Please check the F100 force control gripper control method. The myCobotPro 450 gripper requires the `modbus` control method. Please configure the F100 force control gripper correctly and try again.


**Q6:** Why does the firmware download on the General Firmware page fail?


A: The General Firmware page requires the robotic arm to be connected to the internet. Note that this refers to the robotic arm itself, not the myStudio Pro device. Firmware cannot be downloaded without an internet connection.
