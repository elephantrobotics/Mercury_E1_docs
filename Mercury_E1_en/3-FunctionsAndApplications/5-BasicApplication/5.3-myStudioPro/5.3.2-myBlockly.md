## 2 Basic Function Usage

Let's write a small case study to introduce the basic usage of `myBlockly`

**Case Description:** Control the robotic arm to return to zero, then control one joint to move to a 20-degree position, and then return to zero.

**Step 1:** First, click the `Posture` button to open the attitude view, where you can see the current attitude of the simulated robotic arm.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/posture-btn.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/posture.png" />

- 1: Switch the posture panel: Click to show when the posture panel is hidden, and click to collapse when it is hidden.

- 2: Robotic arm simulation model, which can simulate motion in real time based on the current actual angle.

**Step Two:** Start Programming

Open the toolbox, first-level category `Movement`, select the second-level category `Angle & Coord`, and drag the `Set Angles` block to the workspace.

This block is used to control the movement of each joint of the robotic arm to a given angle. The default movement speed is 20.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case1.png" />

Open the toolbox's primary category `Basic`, select the secondary category `Time`, drag the `Sleep` block to the workspace, and set the sleep time to 3 seconds.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case2.png" />

Copy the `Set Angles` block and modify the `J 1` angle to 20:

- Click to select the `Set Angles` block in the workspace;

- Press Ctrl + C to copy the `Set Angles` block;

- Press Ctrl + V to paste the `Set Angles` block;

- Modify the `J 1` angle of the new block to 20;

- Drag the block to connect it to the `Sleep` block;

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case3.png" />

Similarly, copy the `Sleep` block and set the sleep time to `3`. Seconds;

Copy the first `Set Angles` block in the workspace again;

The complete code is as follows:

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case4.png" />

> This code means:

>
- Control the robotic arm to return to the zero point<br />

> - Wait 3 seconds <br />

> - Move one joint (J1) to a 20-degree position<br />

> - Wait 3 seconds<br />

> - Control the robotic arm to return to the zero point<br />

Finally, click the `Run Plane` button. After opening the panel, click the `Run All` button to start executing the code. The right side of the Run Plane will display the joint and angle coordinates in real time, and the 3D model will also simulate motion.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case-run.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case-run1.png" />

The code has finished running. Click the `X` on the panel to close it.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case-run2.png" />

**Step 3:** Saving and Loading Files (or Saving and Loading the Workspace)

`myBlockly` supports saving and loading the workspace.

Click the `File` button, and a drop-down menu will appear. Click the `Save` button, and a file naming modal will appear. Enter your desired name and click Confirm to save (by default, it will be saved to the test space). The saved result will be displayed as a message in the lower left corner.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case7.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case8.png" />

**Step 4:** Creating a New Workspace (This operation will clear all code in the workspace)

Click the `File` button. A drop-down menu will appear. Click the `Create` button. A prompt will appear. Click the `OK` button.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case9.png" />

Workspace creation complete.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case10.png" />

**Step 5:** Load the previously saved workspace file.

Click the `File` button. A drop-down menu will appear. Click the `Open` button in the menu. A list of saved files will be displayed. Select the file you want to load, and use the edit button in the operation column to load the file into the workspace.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case11.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case12.png" /> 

Loading complete.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/case13.png" />

## 3 Quick Fill

This chapter introduces the Quick Fill function in the block.

When a block has too many data items, filling them one by one is too tedious. Therefore, for blocks with too many data items, we can use the Quick Fill function.

Quick Fill Source: Angle or coordinate data of the current robotic arm posture.

The following blocks currently support quick fill:

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/auto-fill1.png" />

#### How to Use Quick Fill

Taking the `Set Angles` block as an example, first select the block, then click the `Quick Fill` button within it.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/auto-fill2.png" />

When the following prompt box appears on the page, the fill was successful.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/auto-fill3.png" />

## 4 Quick Move

What is **Quick Move**? Simply put, it's controlling the robot's movement quickly with just mouse clicks, without any programming.

> Note: myStudio Pro has two **Quick Move** control panels; their functions are largely the same.

**Step 1:** Click the **Quick Move** button to open the **Quick Move** panel and wait for the robot data to return.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/quickmove1.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/quickmove2.png" />

If all data is zero, please check if the robotic arm is connected and if it is functioning correctly.

**Step 2:** Use the `-` and `+` buttons to control different joints of the robotic arm. Single-point movement, long-press for continuous movement, and direct modification of angles and coordinates followed by pressing `Enter` are supported.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/quickmove3.png" />

**Step 3:** Control the coordinates.

First, you need to move joint 3 to approximately -90 degrees, as shown in the image below.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/quickmove4.png" />

Then you can click the `-` / `+` buttons on different axes to control the coordinates.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/quickmove5.png" />

For other functions, please refer to [Quick Move](./5.3.3-quickmove.md)

## 5 Learning to Use Coordinate Control

**Main APIs Involved:**

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/coords1.png" />

**Set Coord**

- **Prototype:** `send_coords(values,speed)`

- **Interface Description:** Sets multiple coordinates for the robotic arm

- Parameters:

- values: [X,Y,Z,RX,RY,RZ]

- speed: Speed, range 1-100

**Small Case**

**Some operations to be performed before first using coordinate movement:**

- Return the robotic arm to zero position. Refer to [Controlling the robotic arm to zero](./5.5.3-littleCase.md)

- Set the initial posture of the robotic arm's coordinate movement (machine J3 needs to be parallel to the ground)

- As shown in the code below:

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/coords2.png" />

Open the `Run Plane` and run the code.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/coords3.png" />

#### Coordinate Movement

Drag a `Set Coord` block to the workspace, and click the `Quick Fill` button on the block to fill in the data. Change the `Z` axis data to `300`.

The complete code is as follows:

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/coords4.png" />

Execute the code; observe the robotic arm moving up and down throughout the process.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/coords5.png" />

## 6 One-step

One-step execution refers to executing one block at a time. When there are many blocks in the workspace, I only want to execute one block to see the effect. This is where you can use the **One-step** button.

> The **One-step** button is disabled by default and cannot be clicked.

**Step 1:** Drag several joint setting blocks into the workspace.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/singleStep1.png" />

**Step 2:** Select the `Set Joint` block. You will observe that the **One-step** button has been unlocked (its color has changed to a darker shade).

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/singleStep2.png" />

**Step 3:** Click the **One-step** button. This will automatically open the run panel and begin executing the code. Simultaneously, observe the changes in the robotic arm's movement. (Single-step execution sets joint 1 to 30°)

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/singleStep3.png" />

## 7 Program Control

Introduces how to debug block code using the `Run Plane` , enabling program `Pause`, `Recover`, `One-step`, and `Stop`.

Edit a program to control the movement of `joint 1` of the robotic arm.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/program1.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/program2.png" />

Click the `Run Plane` button. When the Run Plane pops up, click `Run All`, and immediately click the `Pause` button. The program will pause after executing the first instruction `mc.send_angle(1,0,20)`.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/program3.png" />

The program is paused. The next instruction to be executed, `time.sleep(3)`, appears.

At this point:

- If you click the `Recover` button, the program will automatically continue execution;

- If you click the `One-step` button, The program will execute the `time.sleep(3)` instruction. When `One-step` is clicked again, the program will execute the next instruction, namely `mc.send_angle(1,-90,20)`;

- If you click the `Stop` button, the program will be terminated;

What happens next is up to you!

## 8 Using Drag-and-Teach

This chapter introduces how to use the drag-and-teach function in `myBlockly`.

This refers to the movement of the manipulator along the direction of the operator's force under the operator's traction (traction of the end or traction of a manipulator).

This function makes it easy to plan trajectories (for tasks where the process trajectory accuracy is not high), so that the operator can record and reproduce the trajectory without manual programming, lowering the barrier to entry for operators and improving efficiency.

**API Display**

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/dragTeach1.png" />

**Small Case Study**

We will achieve the following effect: A robotic arm can be dragged freely to perform some actions. After dragging, the robotic arm will execute the actions just performed. This is equivalent to recording and playing back a trajectory.

The complete code is as follows:

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/dragTeach2.png" />

Code Explanation:

- Record trajectory: After executing this block, the robotic arm's joint brakes release, and the robotic arm can now be dragged.

- Wait 10 seconds (equivalent to recording for 10 seconds)

- Pause recording: The robotic arm's joint brakes lock, and it cannot be dragged manually.

- Wait 10 seconds

- Play trajectory: The robotic arm begins executing the previously recorded trajectory.

- Wait 10 seconds (equivalent to playing back the previously recorded 10-second trajectory)

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/dragTeach3.png" />

## 9 Using the Gripper

This chapter introduces how to use `myBlockly` to control the F100 force control gripper connected to a robotic arm.

**API display**

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/gripper-1.png" />

We will use the following blocks:

1: `Set F100 Force Control Gripper Angle`: Makes the gripper enter a specified state (open or closed) at a specified angle.

Parameter description:

This block has two adjustable parameters:

- Gripper ID parameter: Default 14

- Gripper Angle parameter: Represents the angle to be set, with a value range of 0~100

2: `Read F100 Force Control Gripper Angle`: Reads the current gripper angle value.

This block has one adjustable parameter:

- Gripper ID parameter: Default 14

**Small Case**

The graphical code is as follows:

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.myBlockly/blockly/gripper-2.png" />

- Code execution results:

- Control the F100 force control gripper to reach a position with a value of `80`

- Wait 3 seconds

- Control the F100 force control gripper to reach a position with a value of `20`

- Wait 3 seconds

- Read the current angle value of the F100 force control gripper

- Wait 3 seconds

- Control the F100 force control gripper to reach a position with a value of `0`

**Note**:

If you cannot control the gripper from the above examples, please ensure that your F100 force control gripper communication method is `modbus` protocol control.

After setting, run the small case code again.

## 10 Waypoints
