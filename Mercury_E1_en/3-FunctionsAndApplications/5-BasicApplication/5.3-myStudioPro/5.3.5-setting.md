Furthermore, you can modify the robot control permissions for this network port on this page. If robot control permissions are not enabled, accessing myStudio Pro will display "No control permissions." MyStudio Pro can only be used normally when control permissions are enabled.

**The following explanation is based on the WLAN port.** The control logic for the LAN2 port is the same.

In your browser, enter the IP address of the WLAN port to access MyStudio Pro (Wi-Fi connected & control permissions not enabled).

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.3-myStudioPro/setting/setting-network2.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.3-myStudioPro/setting/setting-network3.png" />

When `enabling`/`disabling` control permissions, a second confirmation is required. Clicking Confirm will successfully enable/disable control permissions.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.3-myStudioPro/setting/setting-network4.png" />

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.3-myStudioPro/setting/setting-network5.png" />

In your browser, enter the IP address of your WLAN port to access myStudio Pro (Wi-Fi connected & control permissions enabled). You will be taken to the account login page. Enter the correct username and password to use myStudio Pro. The default username and password are `admin` and `123`. If you have changed your username and password ([see point 8 for instructions](./5.3.5-setting.md#8-account-settings)), please use the changed username and password to log in; otherwise, you will not be able to use myStudio Pro.

<img width = "800" align = "center" src="../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.3-myStudioPro/setting/setting-network6.png" />

After successful login, the system will first check if any network port is currently using myStudio Pro. If so, a second login confirmation will be required. Clicking "Login" will automatically log the currently used network port offline, allowing you to use myStudio Pro normally. Clicking "Cancel Login" will return you to the login page. Otherwise, you will directly enter the myStudio Pro main interface.
