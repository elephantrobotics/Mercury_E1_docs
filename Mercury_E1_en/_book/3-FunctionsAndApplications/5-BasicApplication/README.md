# Chapter 5: Basic Functions

**This chapter mainly explains the basic functions and usage of the product and the basic software. This chapter is crucial and should be read carefully. Please ensure you understand the described operations correctly before actually using the robot.**

- [5.1 SystemInstructions ](./5.1-SystemInstructions.md)<br>
This section introduces the integrated operating solution for the myCobot Pro robot control system, covering local simplified control (MiniRobot), remote professional programming (myStudio Pro), a secure and flexible network architecture, and standard industrial communication interfaces.

- [5.2 MiniRobot ](./5.2-minirobot/README.md)<br>
This section introduces MiniRobot, the local control panel for the myCobot Pro robotic arm.  Based on miniroboflow adaptation, it supports offline on-site operation via buttons. Its core functions include drag-and-teach programming, status inquiry, basic configuration, communication forwarding, and zero-point calibration, providing an intuitive and convenient human-machine interface.

- [5.3 myStudio Pro ](./5.3-myStudioPro/README.md)<br>
This section introduces myStudio Pro, a multi-functional robot programming and control software that provides users with a one-stop solution for visual programming interaction, quick motion control, drag-and-drop teaching, and robot status inquiry and configuration.  The software primarily integrates four functional modules: myBlockly, Quick Motion, Resource Links, and Settings, covering the entire process from programming to debugging, and from learning to deployment.

- [5.4 SystemUpdate](./5.4-system_flash.md)<br>
This section provides a detailed explanation of the complete process for flashing/updating the system image on the Pro450 robotic arm. The core operation involves writing the new system image file to the device's main controller using a dedicated PC-based tool (RKDevTool).
