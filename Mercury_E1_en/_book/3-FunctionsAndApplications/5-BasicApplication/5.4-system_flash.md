# Pro450 System Image Burning Instructions

**Note:** After the system image is burned, each joint of the robotic arm needs to be **recalibrated at its zero position** before it can be used normally.

This section will guide you on how to use a burning tool on your PC to correctly burn the system image to the Pro450 controller. Please follow the steps strictly to ensure a safe and successful burning process.

## 1 Preparation

Before starting the flashing process, please ensure the following hardware and software are ready:

### Hardware Requirements

| Device | Quantity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Windows PC | 1 unit | Running flashing tools and driver installation |
| Double-headed USB cable | 1 piece | Connecting the PC and the Pro450 |
| Pro450 robot | 1 unit | Device to be flashed |
| Stable power supply | 1 set | Powering the Pro450 (keep powered on) |
| Emergency stop switch | 1 unit | Safety protection |
| Network cable | 1 piece | Connecting the robotic arm to the PC |

### Software Requirements

- Official system image file

- Flashing tool (e.g., RKDevTool_Release_v3.15, subject to availability)

- Corresponding USB driver (usually a USB-to-serial driver for the device)

>> 🔔 Tip: It is recommended to place all tools in the same folder and avoid Chinese characters or spaces in the path.

### Network Configuration

- MyCobot Pro 450 Default IP Address: `192.168.0.232`

- Default Port Number: `4500`

- **Note:** The PC's network card IP address needs to be set to the **same subnet** (e.g., `192.168.0.xxx`, where `xxx` is any number between 2 and 254, and it cannot conflict with the robotic arm).

- Example:

- Robotic Arm IP: `192.168.0.232`

- PC IP: `192.168.0.100`

- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`

- **Verification**: After completing the network configuration, you can execute the following command in the PC terminal. If it successfully returns data packets, the network connection is normal:

  ``bash
  ping 192.168.0.232
  ```

- Ensure the Pro450 is powered on and connected to your computer using an Ethernet cable.

- Remotely SSH into the Pro450 system from your PC to execute the flashing command.

## 6 SSH Remote Connection

Use the `Win + R` shortcut to open the `cmd` command prompt and enter the following command:

`ssh-keygen -R 192.168.0.232`

`ssh root@192.168.0.232`


Follow the prompts to enter `yes`, then enter the login password `root`.

## 7. Start the System Flashing Function

After logging in via SSH, enter the following command to start the system flashing function:

`reboot loader`

- Click the `Upgrade Firmware` button

<img src="../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.9-system_flash/5.9-4.png" width = "800" align = "center">

- Click the `Firmware` button to open File Explorer, select the system image file to be flashed, and then click `Open`.

<img src="../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.9-system_flash/5.9-6.png" width = "800" align = "center">

- After selecting the image file, click the `Upgrade` button.

<img src="../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.9-system_flash/5.9-7.png" width = "800" align = "center">

- After the system image is successfully burned, a prompt message will appear on the right side of the burning tool:

<img src="../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.9-system_flash/5.9-8.png" width = "800" align = "center">

## 9 Verify System Image Burning

After burning the system image, reconnect to the robotic arm system remotely using SSH and enter the following command to check the system version number:

`cat /etc/version`

<img src="../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5-BasicApplication/5.9-system_flash/5.9-9.png" width = "800" align = "center">

The system image file name is associated with the system version number. If the output version number matches the date name of the image file, it means the system image was successfully burned.

**Note:** After the system image is burned, each joint of the robotic arm needs to be **recalibrated at its zero position** before it can be used normally.
