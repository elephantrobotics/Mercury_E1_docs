## 4 Network Port Introduction

The system supports three network interfaces, each used for a different purpose, ensuring both security and network flexibility.

- **LAN1 (Control Network):**
  - Purpose: Dedicated to the transmission of robot control commands.
  - Features: Static IP configuration, not connected to the internet, ensuring real-time control and security.
  - Applicable Scenarios: Local high-real-time control, such as motion commands and sensor data broadcasting.

- **LAN2 (Wired Internet Interface):**
  - Purpose: Connects to the internet for remote access, software updates, etc.
  - Features: Supports DHCP for automatic IP address assignment and allows manual configuration of static IP addresses.
  - Applicable Scenarios: Remote debugging, firmware upgrades, cloud service access.

- **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):**
  - Purpose: Wireless connection to the internet, functionally equivalent to LAN2.
  - Features: Supports Wi-Fi connectivity, suitable for mobile device access.
  - Applicable scenarios: Mobile device control, temporary network access.

> Security notice: By default, the system only allows control via LAN1. Control functions via LAN2/WLAN must be manually enabled and configured with authentication to ensure secure operation.

### Port Configuration Table

| Port Number | Protocol | Function | Real-time Performance | Default Network |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 8000        | TCP      | Main Control Commands | High Real-time        | LAN1 Only       |
| 8001        | UDP      | 100ms Position Broadcast | Medium Real-time      | LAN1 Only       |
| 8002        | UDP      | 10ms Position Broadcast | Ultra-high Real-time  | LAN1 Only       |
| 8100        | WebSocket| Web Control             | Medium Real-time      | LAN1 Only       |
| 9000        | TCP      | Modbus Control          | High Real-time        | LAN1 Only       |
| 8080        | HTTP     | Management Interface    | Low Real-time         | All Networks    |


### Security Mechanisms

#### 1. Permission Switch Control
- Remote control for LAN2 and WLAN can be switched on or off independently.
- Default state: Both are off (most secure).
- When enabled: The control port is simultaneously bound to the corresponding network.

#### 2. Key Security Measures
- **Broadcast Port Locking:** Ports 8001 and 8002 will only be used on LAN1.
- **Mandatory Authentication:** Remote access requires account login.
- **IP Whitelisting:** Only trusted devices are allowed to connect.

### Network Configuration Recommendations

| Usage Scenario | Recommended Configuration | Advantages |
|---|---|---|
| **Production Environment** | LAN1 control + LAN2 monitoring | Secure control, remote viewing |
| **Debugging Environment** | LAN1 control + WLAN debugging | Flexible connection with mobile devices |
| **Educational Environment** | LAN1 control + LAN2 internet access | Student programming, teacher monitoring |
| **Demonstration Environment** | Enable all network permissions | Convenient for demonstration and operation |

## 5. Introduction to Serial Ports

The system has a built-in **RS485 industrial serial communication interface**, which is mainly used to connect external industrial equipment such as PLCs, sensors, and frequency converters to achieve stable and reliable data exchange and command control.

This interface is based on the **Modbus protocol** (a standard communication protocol widely used in the industrial field), which allows for monitoring the robot's status, controlling its motion, and setting its parameters through simple read and write commands.

### Main Applications:

- **Read Robot Status:** Such as joint angles, end effector coordinates, motion mode, I/O status, etc.
- **Send Control Commands:** Control robot movement, start/stop, mode switching, etc.
- **Connect to External Devices:** Interact with industrial equipment such as PLCs, touchscreens, and sensors to build automated systems.

### Typical Use Cases:

- Robotic arm movements are centrally scheduled by a PLC on the production line.
- In conjunction with vision sensors, positioning and grasping are achieved.
- Local control via serial port in environments without a network connection.

### Communication Configuration Recommendations:

- **Baud Rate**: 115200 (Default, compatible with most devices)
- **Protocol**: Modbus RTU
- **Tools**: Common serial port tools such as Modbus Debug Assistant and SSCOM can be used for testing.

> **Note:** Before use, please ensure that the external device supports the Modbus protocol and set the corresponding slave address (default is 45) and register address. For details, please refer to the function list in the protocol manual.
