Once selected, the selected area will be highlighted in reverse. The selected joint can then be rotated using the A and B keys. A short press moves the step angle by 0.1°, while a long press is supported. After moving to the desired zero position, press the C key to save. The corresponding joint angle data on the screen will then change to 0°.
