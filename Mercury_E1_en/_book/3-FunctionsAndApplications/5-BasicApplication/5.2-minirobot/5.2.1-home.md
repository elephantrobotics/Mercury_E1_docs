# First Use

MiniRobot is an interactive module consisting of a TFT screen and buttons. The buttons on the bottom, from left to right, are A, B, C, and D. These buttons allow you to switch between displaying different robotic arm information and control the robotic arm's status.

Before starting MiniRobot, the robotic arm must be powered on and the emergency stop button must be connected. After the robotic arm is powered on, if the backend is not started, MiniRobot will default to displaying all current data as 0, including angle, coordinates, and IP. MiniRobot will automatically update the current data approximately 10 seconds after the robotic arm is powered on.

**Note that MiniRobot, myStudio Pro, and the Python interface have mutually exclusive control over the robotic arm's motion. Only one interface can control the robotic arm at a time. If MiniRobot enters the control interface, myStudio Pro or the Python interface will not be able to control the robotic arm, and vice versa.**

Entering the control interface is indicated by the following:

1. Dragging the teaching interface and its subpages.

2. The BlocklyRunner interface and its subpages.

3. Quick Movement Interface and its sub-interfaces.

4. Zero-position Calibration Interface and its sub-interfaces.

After the robotic arm is powered on, MiniRobot will first display its logo.

Then it will enter the main interface, which by default displays the joint information and static IP information of the current robotic arm.

Pressing the A button will enter the menu interface. Use the icons at the bottom of the screen to select specific functions. **Note that if there is no operation on this interface for 30 seconds, it will automatically redirect back to the main interface.** **

You can switch between displaying different robotic arm information using the buttons at the bottom of the screen. Pressing the C button displays the robotic arm's current coordinates and static IP information.

Pressing the D button displays the current input/output status of the M8 interface at the end. No small dot indicates a low level, and a white dot indicates a high level.
