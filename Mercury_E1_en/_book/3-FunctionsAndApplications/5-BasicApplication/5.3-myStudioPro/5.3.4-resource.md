The myCobot Pro 450 supports remote upgrades and flashing of the latest versions of the main controller, terminal, and screen firmware. The machine defaults to using the latest firmware version. If a new firmware version is released, myStudio Pro will automatically download the latest firmware information as long as a stable network connection is maintained while using it.
